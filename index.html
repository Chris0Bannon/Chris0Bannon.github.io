<p>I have had a ton of fun working on this project.  I hope that it isn't to silly for you folks.  If you would like me to submit something more professional I would be happy to do so.  I put the theme from Pokemon Blue down here since it feels like the beginning of an adventure.  I think I’m going to be really good at this stuff.  You should call me!!</p>
