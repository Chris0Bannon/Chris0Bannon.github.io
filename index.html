<p>I have had a ton of fun working on this project.  Are you impressed with my additional styling components? Or is this design overly clever? If you prefer that I submit something more professional, I would be happy to do so for you.  I put the intro theme from Pokemon Blue here since it feels like the beginning of new adventure!  I think I’m going to be really good at this stuff.  You should call me!!</p>
